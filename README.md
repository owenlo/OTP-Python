# OTP-Python
Randomised One-Time Pad Encryption/Decryption

Example of using a randomised one-time pad for encryption and decryption of a string value in Python. 

During encryption, we replace the plaintext values with the one-time pad values using a static character set to define relative position. For decryption, the one-time pad values give us the position of our plaintext value relative to our character set.
